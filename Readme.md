# Expense Management System

A simple and efficient application to track, analyze, and manage daily expenses.  
It allows users to add and update expenses, view category-wise trends, and analyze monthly spending patterns through a clean and interactive interface.

## 📌 Overview

The Expense Management System helps users stay in control of their finances by providing a structured way to record and analyze expenses.  
It includes three major views:

- **Tab 1:** Add and update daily expenses  
- **Tab 2:** View expense breakdown by categories like rent, shopping, travel, entertainment and more  
- **Tab 3:** View month-wise financial trends to understand spending habits over time  

The goal of the project is to make personal finance tracking simple, fast, and visually clear.
